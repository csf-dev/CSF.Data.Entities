# CSF.Data.Entities
This small library contains types which ease the integration of [CSF.Entities] and [CSF.Data].

## IEntityData
`IEntityData` and its implementations `EntityData` and `IdentityGeneratingEntityData` provide access to an underlying data store. This is typically an ORM-backed database but it could equally be an in-memory data-store for testing scenarios. The API provided by this is similar to that of a repository, *although the name repository has intentionally been avoided*.  Please note that this service exposes a `Query<T>()` method which means that it is *not a true repository*.

If you wish to build a repository (which exposes methods returning `IReadOnlyCollection<T>` or `IReadOnlyList<T>` etc) then you may build them atop this data access service.

## `IQuery<T>` extension methods
This library contains extension methods for `IQuery<T>`, permitting generic type inference of the return type from a generic `IIdentity<T>` instance.

## `InMemoryQuery` extension methods
The library also contains extension methods for `InMemoryQuery`, automatically providing the appropriate identity value to the `Add` method.
